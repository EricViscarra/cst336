                <p>Converting from a decimal base-10 number system to our binary base-2 is easy as long as you know how to divide by two.<br /></p>
                <p>First, take the base-10 whole number that needs to be converted and write it as if you are about to do long division</p>
                <p>and dividing it by two. <br /><br />Then, write down the answer below the box with its own division box and write the remainder, either 0 or 1, to the right.<br /></p>
                <p>Now, you should divide the answer of the previous part by 2, again writing the remainder off to the right.</p>
                <p>Continue until you are left with 1 as your answer. <br /><br />Now if done correctly there should be a column of 1's and 0's.<br /></p>
                <p>This sequence will be the binary representation of the original base-10 value but now we need to know how to read it.</p>
                <p>Writing the binary sequence from left to right, you should read the column from bottom to top. So, using the conversion</p>
                <p>shown in the animation below, 357 converted to binary should be 101100101</p>
